# GOL: Generative One-Shot Learning

GOL (short for Generative One-Shot Learning) is a GUI-based framework for generating synthetic training data for complex deep learning algorithms which, based on a so-called one-shot (template) object plus a small set of regularization samples, generates data as Pareto optimal solutions using a set of generalization functions built into a generalization generator.

## 1D GOL
One-dimensional Pareto optimization problem example.

## Autonomous Vision GOL
Multi-dimensional Pareto optimization applied to the problem of generating artificial training images.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/RovisLab/GOL.git
```

### Prerequisites

Please see individual README.md files for instructions on how to run and install 1D GOL / Autonomous Vision GOL.
